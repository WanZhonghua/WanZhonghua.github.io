Subcortical regions like the thalamus and amygdala are essential for sensory processing and memory. Diffusion MRI maps their complex white matter pathways, making it a powerful tool for identifying structurally informed subcortical subdivisions. We present a novel framework for fine-scale subcortical parcellation by integrating tractography-based connectivity and voxel-level features within a multiscale consensus graph learning framework.
