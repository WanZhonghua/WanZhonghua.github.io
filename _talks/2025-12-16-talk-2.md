In this talk, I present a consensus graph representation learning framework for subcortical parcellation based on diffusion MRI. By constructing voxel-level structural connectivity features from fiber clusters and integrating them through supervoxel-based preparcellation and low-rank tensor modeling, our method produces anatomically coherent and highly reproducible subcortical subdivisions. Extensive experiments demonstrate improved microstructural homogeneity, cross-subject consistency, and anatomical fidelity compared with existing subcortical atlases.
