In this talk, we present a unified two-stage framework for cross-species cortical parcellation between humans and macaques. By integrating multimodal connectivity features with low-rank tensor learning, our method identifies evolutionarily conserved cortical regions while accounting for inter-individual variability and noise. Experimental results demonstrate improved cross-species alignment and mapping consistency compared with existing approaches.
